You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque61B:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The resize method of the staff solution took in an argument of the new capacity, which differed from my solution with both a resizeUp and resizeDown method. While my solution did not require a new capacity argument, it did repeat a lot of code, which the staff solution could have made my syntax easier to read.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I actually finished! Also I was able to write all the methods without too much help.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque61B?

A: I learned that I was not the only one who struggled with the resize method.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque61B, if anything?

A: I wish I knew the syntax for the resizeUp and resizeDown methods. I had to scrape through the lecture slides to find a reference.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque61B again, what would you do differently, if anything?

LinkedListDeque61B:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was able to create my own visualization of the LinkedList while I was coding my solution, and used it to help implement my solution more elegantly.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Probably my Node class. It did not take in next and prev constructors, so I had to set them seperately in each method.
