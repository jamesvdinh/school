### Course structure: 3 modules

1. **Foundations**: GIS fundamentals, computational thinking & Python recap
2. **Urban data wrangling & visualization**: acquire, clean, and visualize tabular & geospatial data in different formats
3. **Urban Systems**: Weekly subsystems analyzzed using real data w/ ethical & visualization considerations

### Lab Sessions

- **hands-on learning**: reingorce lecture concepts w/ practical exercises, will submit progress at end of each session
- **Python basics**: review coding fundamentals via pre-class videos
- ACS

### Attendance Policy

- **NOT mandatory**
- **Frequent absences**: more than 25% sessions missed -> will impact final grade

# Lecture

## What is a city?

Cities are social institutions

### Cities are complex systems

- Environment
- Economic
- Housing
- Transportation
- Infrastructure

## Urban data

- space + time (where & when?)
- surge in availability of fine-scale data
- still a large gap in data availability across different parts of urban systems
- synthetic data being generated at an unprecedented level

### various models & formats

- transportation
  - road network data: line
  - incident level data: point
- housing and land use
  - land use & zoning: polygon
- environmental
  - remote sensing data: raster
