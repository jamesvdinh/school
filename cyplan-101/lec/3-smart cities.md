# Week 3

## Vision Zero in NYC

Has it improved the situation in NY since implementation? (less fatalities)

1. is there a causal relationship between these patterns and VZ plan?

## Smart cities

### define

- what does it mean in this context?
- for whom?
- who controls the data and decision-making algos
- compared to what?

#### Resilience

- resilient to what shocks: flood, pandemics, economic shutdowns, daily disruptions?
- for whom?

#### world-class cities

- by whose standard? -> global rankings, local residents
- in what domain? -> finance, transport, culture
- compared to what? -> peer cities regionally ,blocal capitals, or an ideal benchmark

> Takeaway
>
> Before starting data analysis,
>
> - clear definition
> - clear picture of desired outcome
> - measureable objectives (where, when, for whom)?
>
> Do not just assume; ask, make clear

### Final project

- define key terms explicitly
- cite source of definition
  - is it from published paper?
  - city agency?
  - international standard?
  - explain why you chose it? Why does definition make sense for project, context, or audience

## Computational Thinking Principles

- decomposition
  - city
  - neighborhoods
  - zoning districts
- abstraction
  - represent problems in a simplified, general way
  - focus on critical aspects of problem
- pattern recognition
  - identifying patters or trends within a problem
  - identify specific similarities and differences
- algorithm
  - step by step instructions for solving a problem
