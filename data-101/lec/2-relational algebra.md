# Relational Algebra

**Table/Relation**: collection of tuples w/ predefined collection of attributes

- relation = schema + instance
- columns can be reordered; relation stays the same

**Schema**: the structure, format, or scaffolding defining a relation

- similar to interface in TS

**Instance**: a relation with values "filled in", a specific instantiation

**Database schema**: the structure, format, or scaffolding defining a collection of relations

**Relational Algebra**: theory of operations that help us transform relations (operands)

- Notation: $R(B_1, B_2, ..., B_m)$

## Primitive RA operations

> Unary operators: $S = f(R)
>
> - selection, projection, renaming

### Selection

### Projection

Cross out columns

$$pi_{A_1, A_2, ..., A_n}(R))$$

Operation: keep only columns $A_1, ..., A_n$

### Renaming

### Cartesian Product (cross product)

### Union

### Difference
