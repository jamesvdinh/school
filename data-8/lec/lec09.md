## Types of plots

- **Histogram**: good for measuring counts over time.
- **Line Plot**: trends over time
- **Scatter Plot**: only relationships (time is irrelevant)
- **Bins**:
  - % over x-axis: is the percent of that bin as a portion of the entire dataset, aka the area of the bin.
    - Ex. if a bin is [25, 40), and % over age is 1.3, the percentage of movies in that bin is around 15 \* 1.3 = 20% of the dataset.
