# 1 - sIntroduction to GIS

## Why use a GIS?

- collect & store data (survey data, asset data, census data)
- visualize data (where is Berkeley Way West?)
- explore data (is there a parking lot adjacent to BWW)
- analyze data (how far is the nearest parking lot from BWW?)
- communicate data (dashboards or storymaps)

## Layers to a map

- base map
- point layer
  - Location of points is an event

### Vector Data

points, lines, polygons

- point pattern data, only attributes are the location (X, Y values)
- geospoatial data, we have additional data such as when sample was collected, who the interviwer is
- areal data - aggregation of data or points - always has shape area and shape length

### Scale

- geographic scale, or cartographic or map scale, is the zoom level
- areal data is the geographic area
  - could be a block, block group, census tracts, zip codes, OR ZCTA codes, city, county, state, country
