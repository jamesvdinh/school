# Assignment 4

1. Define Electronic Health Records (ii) List three of the functions of Electronic Health Records (service EHR can provide)

Electronic Health Records, or EHRs, are real-time, digital patient-centered records. They serve several important functions. First, EHRs contain information about a patient's medical history, diagnoses, medications, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and lab and test results. Second, EHRs offer access to evidence-based tools that providers can use in making decisions about a patient's care. Third, EHRs automate and streamline provider's workflow by increasing organization and accuracy of patient information.

2. List three AND explain three benefits of Electronic Health Records

Electronic Health Records offer several benefits to both patients and health care providers. First, they reduce paperwork for both parties since EHRs record all past visit information about a patient's health record and can be easily be updated in a structure and uniform manner. Second, EHRs help doctors coordinate patient care and safety by warning providers if a prescribed drug can cause a harmful reaction with another drug on the patient's EHR. Third, EHRs give the patient direct access to their health records which improves the patient's literacy and awareness of their own health, thus leading to better health care outcomes and ease of mind.

3. List three ways Electronic Health Records can benefit clinicians and patients by creating efficiencies and reducing costs

Electronic Health Records can benefit clinicians and patients in terms of efficiency and costs by several factors. First, EHRs improve medical practice management through integrated scheduling systems that link appointments directly to progress notes, automate coding, and managed claims. Second, EHRs save time with easier centralized chart management, condition-specific queries, and other shortcuts. Third, they enhance communication with other clinicians, labs, and health plans through easy access to patient information from anywhere.

4. Define Health Information Exchange (ii) List two benefits of Health Information Exchange

Health Information Exchange (HIE) allows health care professionals and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient's medical information electronically. HIEs provide many benefits. First, HIEs enables providers to access and confidentially share patients' vital medical history, no matter where patients are receiving care—specialists’ offices, labs, or emergency rooms. Second, HIEs provide safer, more effective care tailored to patients’ unique medical needs.

5. List and define three Health IT terms

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a real-time patient health record with access to evidence-based decision support tools that can be used to aid clinicians in decision making. The EHR can automate and streamline a clinician's workflow, ensuring that all clinical information is communicated. It can also prevent delays in response that result in gaps in care. The EHR can also support the collection of data for uses other than clinical care, such as billing, quality management, outcome reporting, and public health disease surveillance and reporting. Personal Health Record (PHR) is an electronic application through which individuals can maintain and manage their health information (and that of others for whom they are authorized) in a private, secure, and confidential environment. Health Information Technology (HIT) is the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making.

6. Explain in your own words what is the Internet of Things (IoT). (II) And how IoT can improve service delivery

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of wireless and diverse technological devices that collect, send, and store data across a network without human or computer user interaction. IoT can improve service delivery by streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients through a variety of digital devices and sensors.

7. What is Healthcare Data? (II) Give three examples of tools used to collect, store, share and analyze data

Healthcare data refers to any information related to an individual's physical or mental health, healthcare services, or outcomes. There are several tools used to collect, store, and analyze data. The first is Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which collect and store patients' medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, lab results, and more. Second is Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) which enable the secure sharing of healthcare data across different healthcare organizations. Third is Internet of things (IoT) which utilize digital devices and sensors to collect and record patient data over an interconnected network.

8. Explain the importance of Health Care Data Analytics

Health Care Data Analytics plays a crucial role in healthcare, by driving improvements in patient care, operational efficiency, and research and development. Patient data analysis allows healthcare providers to identify patterns, predict risks, and personalize treatment plans, thus leading to better health outcomes for the patient, while also optimizing resource allocation, reducing costs, and streamlining healthcare operations.

9. List and explain the three types of Health Care Analytics

The three types of Health Care Analytics are Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics, and Prescriptive Analytics. Descriptive Analytics summarizes historical data to reveal insights into past occurrences and allows healthcare organizations to extract knowledge and gain an understanding of past performance, leading to informed decision making. Predictive Analytics uses statistical algorithms and machine learning to analyze historical data to predict future outcomes which enhances personalized care plans and optimizes resource allocation. Prescriptive Analytics combines information from descriptive and predictive measures to recommend actions for improving performance and patient care which leads healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and optimize treatment strategies.

10. List three of the skills required for Health Data Analysts

Health Data Analysts require multiple skills for their evolving field. First, they must have strong proficiency in data collection tools such as Structured Query Language (SQL) and Excel. Second, they must have strong knowledge and understanding of data analysis techniques such as statistical programming and data visualization. Third, they must have strong soft skills such as analytical, critical, and creative thinking, attention to detail, strong communication skills, and leadership skills.
